# NewWorldLib

This library provides functionality to parse and extract `.pak` files used by Amazon's New World.

Data is compressed using `Oodle`. `OozSharp` is currently used to perform the decompression however it does not implement all of the modes that New World uses. Unfortunately this will need to be replaced by the official `Oodle` library in order for all of the files to be decompressed properly.

# NewWorldLib.Console

This is a sample application that shows how to extract the files from the `.pak` asset files of the New World game.

# NewWorldLib.Discord

Still under construction.
